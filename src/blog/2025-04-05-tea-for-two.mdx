You've arrived at the perfect time! 
I got a nice oolong ready to brew up for us and a few snacks in store.

Don't worry, there's nothing you needed to bring or prep for our tea. Come as you are. 
I want to learn about you, what you've done, why you did it, and what you would have done differently. 
Our time together should be fun and comforting rather than me summoning the Spanish Inquisition. 
Think of this as your curious friend trying to dig into everything and learn from you.

Isn't this much nicer? 
I know any time you have a job on the line there's always going to be stress, but I hope this is at least an upgrade over what you're used to.
If you really want to we can do a whiteboard grind while you're here, but that doesn't sound fun.
Plus, we won't learn nearly as much from that.

Hopefully you have fun geeking out about tech and engineering. There's nothing better than learning something new from someone else.
Maybe we'll go off the rails a bit, but that is ok! We have to work together and there's more to life than writing algorithms all day.

If you work with us I want to understand what you've built, how you've built it, why you built it like that, and what you would have changed.
We want to know what you can do for us, where we can help you grow, and how you have already grown.

Does technology and engineering excite you or is it a means for a nice paycheck? 
There's nothing wrong with being in this field for the great salary, 
but we've also seen that passionate individuals grow best. They look to refine their skills, 
seek out new ways to solve problems, pick up new technology, 
and are more willing to dive into unknown challenges.

All your questions will be answered as we commit the last fifteen minutes for you to grill us.
I can even run over our the scheduled time and if that is still not enough feel free to email me more questions.

Hopefully our friendlier interview experience has left a positive impression on you. 
We definitely hope should you have competing offers that this will be part of why you choose to work with us.

Thanks again for taking time out of your day to have some tea and chat. 
I hope that this will be a highlight of your day as we aim for it to be a highlight of ours as well.
