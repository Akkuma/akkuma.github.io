# How about a spot of tea?

Welcome to my humble abode. Now sit darling, sit. I hear you're interested in joining me for some tea? 
Is it true? Truly true? 

So it is? Quite splendid! But before we can have any tea I have a favor to ask. Well, more than just a single favor.
I have multiple favors to ask of you. In fact, I have a lot of favors to ask of you. Worry not! For these are
certainly not the labours of Hercules. No, no. These are but necessary steps to prove you and I are a fantastic match
for afternoon tea.
