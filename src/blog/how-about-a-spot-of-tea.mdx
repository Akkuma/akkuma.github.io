Welcome to my humble abode. Now sit darling, sit. I hear you're interested in joining me for some tea? 
Is it true? Truly true? 

So it is? Quite splendid! But before we can have any tea I have a favor to ask. Well, more than just a single favor.
I have multiple favors to ask of you. Let me be honest, I have a lot of favors to ask of you. Worry not! For these are
certainly not the labours of Hercules. No, no. These are but necessary steps to prove we are a fantastic match
for afternoon tea.

Are you ready? I'm sure you are as everyone wants a chance of tea with me. Who wouldn't? I offer the finest teas,
the best company, and the best afternoon tea snacks.

First, I'm going to need you to tell me why you're absolutely completely head over heels in love with the idea of having tea with me.
I know, I know it does sound a bit narcissistic, but I really need to know how well you can compliment me. Plus we should start building
up our rapport early on. How does one enjoy afternoon tea with another in nothing but silence? Honestly though there has been an explosion 
of interest in tea with me, so I won't be able to afford more than a few moments. Better get in the flattery quickly!

Alright with that out of the way I'd like for you to provide me a complete list of your tea brewing accomplishments. 
We cannot have any random person brewing our extraordinary tea and ruining it, can we? The lengths we go to procuring
our tea would make even kings, queens, and sultans jealous. Such exquisite tea can only be had by the best and only the best brewers.

Well it does sound like you are quite the marvelous partner for tea! But, I've seen my fair share of cunning con artists 
and although you've made it through this far you have yet to demonstrate anything of value to me. We cannot afford the risk
of our tea and our time falling into nefarious hands.
